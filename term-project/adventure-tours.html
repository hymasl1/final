                        <p class="article-written">This is part of a larger trail called Bangtail Divide. The full trail is about 23.5 miles long... probably 95% singletrack. You can start at either end; Brackett Creek or Stone Creek. Stone Creek is a few miles closer to Bozeman on Bridger Canyon rd. Different folks have different preferences as to which way to ride it but it's fun both ways. Not having a shuttle causes either a ~10 mile road ride or 23.5 mile trail ride back to the car. ASAP. <br>- HarryHoodlum</p>
                        <p>Nice somewhat long but easy climb on a forest road to get you warmed up for a killer descent. Add in great scenery and close proximity to Bozone Brewing in Bozeman and you've got yourself**reat day. If you're up for more than the 16 miles, you can hang a right on the Bangtail Divide trail at the top on Grassy Mountain before you turn around and ride the descent to Bracket Creek trailhead. The 5 miles of road ride at the end is a piece of cake, 2 small climbs before 2-3 miles of downhill with excellent view of the Bridger Range on your right. Good times. <br>- rth009 </p>
